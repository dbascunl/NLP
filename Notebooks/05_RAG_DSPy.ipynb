Relacionado con lo anterior RAG, reporta información más precisa, por ejemplo, cuando la pregunta hace referencia a Stevie ray vaughan, precisa que tuvo un accidente en un helicoptero, no en una \"aeronave\". Esto también se aborda cuando se realiza una pregunta de testeo en el apartado 4.2, preguntando '¿Qué es un reporte financiero?', observándose el mismo efecto.\n",

Vemos que en el caso del RAG la precisión es mayor."
